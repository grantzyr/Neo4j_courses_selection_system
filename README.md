Figure 1. Unit Node

These are all relationships and nodes I have set in my graph. The green one is degree; two dark blue nodes are student node. Left nodes are all unit nodes. Each of unit node has 8 properties. Just shows as Figure 2. 
“<id>” is automatically generated by the system. 
“code” is the unique properties; it is the main attribute that we retrieve. 
“cp” means credit point. 
“level” distinguishes which grade they belong to. This is also a label, with 100level courses in blue node, 200level in red node, 300level in brown and 400level in pink. 
“or” stands for courses that can be replaced with each other, which is also the meaning of "OR" relationship in the picture.
“prerequisite” means you need to complete the courses listed there before you can take this course. This is also one of the relationships in the picture above: PREREQUISITE. 
 “prohibited” means that you will not be able to take this course if you select one of the courses on the “prohibited” list. This also one of the relationships in the picture above. 
“title” means the name of the course.

Figure 4. Student Properties

I only set one degree which is “MATH”. Figure 3 is the properties of math degree. 
“<id>” is automatically generated by the system.
“code” is the same as “Unit Node”, it a unique property. We will use this to identify degrees if we add other degrees.
The remaining 5 CP attributes are the graduation requirements of the degree, for example, a total of 60CP is required, among which 100 level requires 18CP, etc.

Figure 4 is the properties of student.
““<id>” is automatically generated by the system.”
“completed” means the list of courses that the student has currently completed.
“degree” means student’s degree.
“name” means student’s name.
“sid” is a unique property, used to find student we need.

## Relationships <a id='2'></a>
“PREREQUISITE”: Need to complete the courses listed in PREREQUISITE before taking this course. Example: A prerequisite B, then you have to complete B before taking A.
“PROHIBITED”: Not able to take this course if already completed one of the courses listed in PROHIBITED. Example: A prohibited B. If you completed B, then cannot take A.
“OR”: If there is a OR relationship between courses in the prerequisite list of a course, then only need to choose one of them to meet the requirements. Example: A prerequisite B OR C, complete either B or C can take A.
“AND”:  If there is a AND relationship between courses in the prerequisite list of a course, then must complete both to meet the requirement. Example: A prerequisite (B OR C) AND D. You need to complete (B and D) or (C and D) to meet the requirement.
